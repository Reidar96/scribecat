/**
 * Folder notes: a folder's own text, stored *inside* the folder under one
 * reserved file name. That placement is the whole design — moving, renaming
 * or deleting the folder (in ScribeDog or in the OS) carries the note along
 * without any mapping, id or repair step. The file is a normal markdown file
 * for everything except the tree: search, versioning, export and the agent
 * treat it like any other note, only the sidebar attaches it to the folder
 * row instead of listing it next to its siblings.
 *
 * Pure path helpers only, no filesystem and no store: the tree builder, the
 * store slices and the agent tools all import from here, and several of
 * their tests mock the fs layer.
