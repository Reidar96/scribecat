/**
 * Icons for files and folders: an emoji per entry, stored in the vault's
 * `.scribecat/` directory rather than in the documents themselves.
 *
 * That placement is the design. An icon is how the tree looks to the person
 * who set it, not something the note says about itself — it has no business
 * in the markdown, in an export, or in a diff. Keeping it out also means
 * setting one is not an edit: no dirty state, no version, no save. And a
 * folder has no file to carry frontmatter at all, so a sidecar is the only
 * place where files and folders can work the same way.
 *
 * The price is that entries are keyed by vault-relative path: renaming or
 * moving inside ScribeCat carries the icon along (the store calls
 * `renameIconPath`), renaming in the OS does not — the watcher only sees one
 * path gone and another appeared. `order.json` makes the same trade.
 *
 * Pure data, no filesystem: vaultMeta.ts reads and writes the file, the store
 * owns the state, and the tests can exercise the path arithmetic on its own.
